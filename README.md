# YensoGram

This project was created as a result of the requirement to complete [Harvard University's CS50 Final Project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/project/).

YensoGram is basically a blog web application that allows a user to make posts and send messages in form of chats to other users. It was developed using Python (Flask), SQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION


A new user signs up for an account with an email, username and password. When signed up, the user logs in using his/her details. Intially, the user
has no friends and thus no posts to be seen. The application allows the user to find other users and add them as friends. When the user makes a post,
it will be visible to other users who are friends with him/her and vice versa. The user can also send messages to other users
who are friends with him. YensoGram also allows the abilty to update and delete posts or chats made by the user.

If you're familiar with Flask, [application.py](/application.py) is where the main back-end source code lives on. [helpers.py](/helpers.py) contains some helper functions that
are used in [application.py](/application.py).
The front-end html files are in [templates](/templates) folder and [finance.db](/finance.db) is a sqlite database for the application. A version of YensoGram
built with Django is underway.
